Aiptasia Transporters Quantification Project

Pipeline and all FIJI macros needed for channels quantification, segmentation and cell numbers can be found in FIJI pipline. Please note that macros are numbered seperately for each downstream analysis and should be run in order.
All Fiji output files (Data) are uploaded in 'Quantification' folder for each transporter. Three dimensional reconstructions of intacellular localizations are upload to '3D Reconstruction' folder.
