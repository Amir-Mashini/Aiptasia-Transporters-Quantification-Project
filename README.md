Aiptasia Transporters Quantification Project

Pipeline and all FIJI macros needed for channels quantification, segmentation and cell numbers can be found in FIJI pipline. Please note that macros are numbered seperately for each downstream analysis and should be run in order.
All Fiji output files (Data) are uploaded in 'Quantification' folder for each transporter. 3D reconstructions of intacellular localizations as well as 2D images of the same reconstruction are upload to '3D Reconstruction' folder. Symbionts ITS2 sequencing results can be found in 'Genotyping Results'
