Aiptasia Transporters Quantification Project

Pipeline and all FIJI macros needed for channel quantification, segmentation and cell numbers can be found in FIJI pipline. Please note that macros are numbered seperately for each downstream analysis and should be run in labelled numbers order.
All Fiji output files (Data) are uploaded in 'Quantification' folder for each transporter. 3 dimensional reconstructions of intacellular localizations are upload to '3D Reconstruction' folder.
