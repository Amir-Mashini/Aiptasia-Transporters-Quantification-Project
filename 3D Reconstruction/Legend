Immunofluorescence localisation (3D reconstructions and 2D iamges) of nutrient transporters in Aiptasia hosting Breviolum minutum.

Red, chlorophyll autofluorescence of symbionts; 
cyan, nuclear staining of host and symbionts using DAPI; 
yellow, anti-AMT1, anti-VHAB, anti-GLUT8 and anti-AQP3 localisation using AlexaFluor555 conjugated secondary antibody. 

Note: All images were obtained using a 100x oil immersion objective (Olympus). 2D images of the same reconstructions are also uploaded and labeled.
These 2D images are maximum intensity Z-projection. Please refer to 3D reconstructions for a clearer representation of localisations in the space.
